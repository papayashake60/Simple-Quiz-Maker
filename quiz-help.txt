Multiple choice Quiz 
Help file.
---------------------------------
This is a multiple choice quiz where four possible answers
are given for each question, three of those answers are wrong,
you have to find the correct answer to earn a point.

You must choose an answer of A, B, C or D and then click on
the corresponding button.

If you get it correct you earn a point and we move on to the
next question.

If you get it wrong you do not earn a point and the answer
is not revealed either, but we still move on to the next 
question.

Each time the quiz is run the answer order is mixed up as an
added twist.

Enjoy.

I would hope that if you successfully create a quiz 
with SQM, or use the source code, that you would
be good enough to make a small contribution to 
the author by clicking "Make a small donation" item
from the SQM drop-down menu.
This will spur me on to do more work on this project.
Thanks.
